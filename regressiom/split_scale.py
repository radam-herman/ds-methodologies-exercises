# REGRESSION - split_scale.py exercise

# Each scaler function should create the object, 
# fit and transform both train and test. 
# They should return the scaler, train df scaled, 
# test df scaled. Be sure your indices represent 
# the original indices from train/test, as those represent 
# the indices from the original dataframe. 
# Be sure to set a random state where applicable for reproducibility!
